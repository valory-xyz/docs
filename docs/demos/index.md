# Demo autonomous AI Agents

Here you can find a number of already deployed AI agents that showcase the potential
of the {{open_autonomy}} framework. You can fetch the  AI agents (and/or 
the corresponding agent blueprints) from the remote IPFS registry and explore them by yourself.

- [Hello world AI agent](https://stack.olas.network/demos/hello-world/): a demo AI agent to showcase
  how to use the main components in an AI agent,  without external interactions.
- [Price oracle demo](./price-oracle/index.md): a full AI agent implementing a
  price oracle where each agent instance collects price estimates from a different source.
