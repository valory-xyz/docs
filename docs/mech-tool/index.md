## **Overview** 

This guide contains guidelines for contributing to the development of Mechs and offer services.

In order to offer services, anyone can create and deploy their own Mech agents. First, developers can use existing pieces of code, called tools, or create and publish new ones. Once tools are created, Mech agents can be deployed on the Olas Registry. At this point, a Mech contract can be created via the [Mech MarketPlace](#appendix-what-is-the-mech-marketplace). Mech agents, when creating on-chain Mech contracts via the Mech Marketplace, can choose among three distinct payment models, each defining how the requester can pay for the service requested. Specifically, the payment models are the following:

- Native:  A fixed-price model where the requester pays using the chain with native token native token for each delivered service;

- Token: Similar to the Native model, but payments are made using a specified ERC20 token;

- Nevermined subscription: A dynamic pricing model that allows flexible pricing across different services.

Mech agent deployment and related Mech contract creation process is handled by the [Mech quickstart](#2-running-a-mech-locally-on-the-mech-marketplace), and the main inputs to provide are the list of tools to be used, and the chosen payment model. It is also possible to follow these steps [manually](#3-deploying-a-mech-on-the-mech-marketplace-manually).

The detailed instructions to create tools, test them locally and deploy a Mech agent, and accrue payments can be found below.
 
## 1. Creating and publishing a tool

In order to contribute to Mechs' abilities, you can create and publish a tool. In order to do so, follow the instructions below. 

### 1. 1. Creating a tool

**Requirements**:
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/) `>= 3.10`
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) `>=1.4.0` 

In order to create a tool, the steps are as follows: 

**1.** Fork the [mech](https://github.com/valory-xyz/mech) repository and clone the forked copy.
You may use GitHub's UI or its CLI tools:

```bash
gh repo fork https://github.com/valory-xyz/mech --clone=true
```

**2.** Install the dependencies, set up a remote registry, and fetch the third-party packages from IPFS.
You may use the following command after replacing the value for the `AUTHORNAME` variable:

```bash
AUTHORNAME=author

cd mech && \
poetry install && \
poetry run autonomy init --remote --ipfs --author $AUTHORNAME && \
poetry run autonomy packages sync --update-packages
```

**3.** Create the tool's structure by using the following command, after replacing the values for the `AUTHORNAME` and `TOOL_NAME` variables:

```bash
AUTHORNAME=author
TOOL_NAME=tool_name

TOOL_PATH=packages/"$AUTHORNAME"/customs/"$TOOL_NAME"
YEAR=$(date +"%Y")

mkdir -p $TOOL_PATH && \
cat > $TOOL_PATH/component.yaml <<EOF
name: $TOOL_NAME
author: $AUTHORNAME
version: 0.1.0
type: custom
description: Tool description
license: Apache-2.0
aea_version: '>=1.0.0, <2.0.0'
fingerprint:
    __init__.py:
    $TOOL_NAME.py:
fingerprint_ignore_patterns: []
entry_point: $TOOL_NAME.py
callable: run
dependencies: {}
EOF

for file in __init__.py "$TOOL_NAME.py"; do
  cat > $TOOL_PATH/$file <<EOF

EOF
done

cat >> "$TOOL_PATH/$TOOL_NAME.py" <<EOF
"""The implementation of the $TOOL_NAME tool."""


def run(*args, **kwargs):
    """The callable for the $TOOL_NAME tool."""
    # TODO: Implement the tool logic
    print(f"Running $TOOL_NAME with {args=} and {kwargs=}.)

EOF

poetry run autonomy packages lock
```

This command will generate the following structure, with template code:

```
packages/  
 ├── authorname/  
 │   ├── customs/  
 │   │   ├── tool_name/  
 │   │   │   ├── component.yaml
 │   │   │   ├── tool_name.py
 │   │   │   ├── __init__.py
```

**4.** Now that your tool's structure is set up, 
all that's left is to configure the tool component and implement the tool's functionality in Python.
The `component.yaml` file contains the tool's configuration. 
Here is an explanation of its fields:
- name: the name of the tool.
- author: the author's name.
- version: the version of the tool.
- type: the component type of the `open-autonomy` framework. This should be `custom`.
- description: the description of the tool.
- license: the licencing of the tool. It should be Apache-2.0.
- aea_version: the supported `open-aea` version.
- fingerprint: unique hash of the tool. This is auto-generated by the framework's `autonomy packages lock` command.
- fingerprint_ignore_patterns: ignore patterns for the fingerprint's generation.
- entry_point: the module which contains the tool's implementation.
- callable: points to the function which is called in the tool's module.
- dependencies: the module's dependencies. You may specify them in the following format:

```
dependencies:
    dependency_1:
        version: ==0.5.3
    dependency_2:
        version: '>=2.20.0'
```

### 1. 2. Publishing the tool

Before proceeding, make sure that you are inside the poetry environment:
```bash
poetry shell
```

**1.** Create the package hash, by running the following commands, from the root:

```bash
autonomy packages lock
```

At this point you will be prompted to choose "dev" or "third-part". Choose "dev".

**2.** Push the packages to IPFS: 

```bash
autonomy push-all
```

**3.** Mint the tool [here](https://registry.olas.network/ethereum/components/mint) as a component on the Olas Registry; 
For this is needed: an address (EOA), 
and the hash of the meta-data file. 
In order to generate this hash, 
click on “Generate Hash & File” and provide the following information: 
name (name of the tool); 
description (of the tool); 
version (this needs to match the version in the file `component.yaml`); 
package hash (this can be found in `packages.json` under the `packages` folder); 
NFT image URL (for instance on IPFS, supported domains are listed in the window). 
In order to push an image on IPFS, there are two options: 

1. Use this [script](https://github.com/dvilelaf/tsunami/blob/v0.9.0/scripts/ipfs_pin.py). 
   Place the image in a folder called `mints` in `.jpg` format. 
   Then, run the script:
```bash
python ipfs_pin.py
```

2. Use the [mech-client](https://github.com/valory-xyz/mech-client.git), 
   replacing `<file_name>` with the name of your file:
```bash
poetry add mech-client &&\
mechx push-to-ipfs ./<file_name>
```

After this the tool can be deployed to be used by a [Mech](#2-running-a-mech-locally-on-the-mech-marketplace). 


## 2. Running a Mech locally on the Mech Marketplace

In order to register a Mech on the Mech Marketplace - including Mech service creation and deployment, and Mech contract deployment - follow the instructions below. 

**Requirements**: [Python](https://www.python.org/) == 3.10; [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) >= 1.8.3 ; [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 

**1.** Clone the quickstart repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/valory-xyz/quickstart.git
cd quickstart
```

**2.** Configure the Mech service by changing the variables in the file `configs/config_mech.json`. You can in particular 
change the value of "agent_id". This corresponds to the code of the off-chain agent in the Mech service. The list of agents can be found [there](https://registry.olas.network/ethereum/agents). Change the value of "use_mech_marketplace" to true if you want to deploy a Mech on the Mech Marketplace. 

**3.** Change the value the key "value" in `METADATA_HASH` and in `TOOLS_TO_PACKAGE_HASH` in order to use your custom tools.
In order to change the first one, use the [mech-client](https://github.com/valory-xyz/mech-client.git). 
Clone the repository and create a local file, following the model provided by the IPFS hash in the file `configs/config_mech.json`. Then run the following, replacing `<file_name>` with the name of your file:

```bash
poetry add mech-client &&\
mechx push-to-ipfs ./<file_name>
```

Then place the second hash value which appears in the terminal in the file `configs/config_mech.json`. 

In order to change the value in `TOOLS_TO_PACKAGE_HASH`, follow the format and add your tools and their hashes (created in the first [section](#1-creating-and-publishing-a-tool)).


**3.** Run the following in order to deploy and run a new Mech: 

```bash
chmod +x run_service.sh
./run_service.sh configs/config_mech.json
```

**4.** You will be prompted to provide an RPC endpoint (using QuickNode for instance), to choose to use a staking contract or not (choose option 1 by default), to enter API keys, the payment model of the Mech (Native, Token, Nevermined), and to add funds to two addresses, which correspond to the agent's address and the safe contract address of the Mech. The API keys dictionary that you enter should contain all the keys necessary for running your tools. You can find the Mech address using the transaction hashes displayed in the logs.

**5.** When you see the following, the service is running: 

![alt text](image-1.png)

**6.** In order to see the logs, run the following command in a separate terminal: 

```bash
docker logs $(docker ps --filter "name=<mech>" --format "{{.Names}}" | grep "_abci" | head -n 1) --follow
```


## 3. Deploying a Mech on the Mech Marketplace (manually)

In order to deploy a Mech, it is also possible to do so manually, first by deploying a service, registering it on the Mech Marketplace, and then running it locally.

### 3.1 Creating a Mech service

In order to create the service, go to the [Olas Registry](https://registry.olas.network/gnosis/services) webpage. 

**1.** Choose the network and connect your wallet. 

**2.** Click on the button "Mint".

**3.** Click on the `Prefill address` button in order to fill the `owner address` field. You will need to have funds on this address in order to deploy the service. For the hash of the metadata file, click on "Generate Hash & File". The hash should be the one found in the file `packages/packages.json` in the mech-predict [repository](https://github.com/valory-xyz/mech-predict/) for the key `service/valory/mech/`. Select first the prefix and fill the field with the remaining part. The version is contained in this key (e.g. `service/valory/mech/0.1.0`). For the agent id, follow the instructions on the opened page (for instance agent id = 9 to test). The number of slots corresponds to the number of agents that the service contains (we suggest 1 to test). For the cost of agent bound, we suggest that you use a small value (e.g., 1000000000000000 GörliWei = 0.001 GörliETH). We suggest to write threshold = 1 to test. Then click on submit.

**4.** Click on "Services". The last entry corresponds to the service you have created. Click on "View".

**5.** Click first on "Activate registration" (Step 1). Then in the field "Agent Instance Addresses" (Step 2), enter one address (not the same one as the one used as owner address) for each agent in the service, and click on "Register Agents". Choose a service multisig (Step 3) and click on "Submit".

**6.** The service is now deployed, and you can see the safe contract address below. You will need this address in order to run the Mech.

### 3.2 Registering the service on the Mech Marketplace

In order to register your service on the Mech Marketplace, follow the instructions below.

**1.** Find [here](https://github.com/valory-xyz/ai-registry-mech/blob/v0.4.0/docs/configuration.json) the address of MechMarketPlaceProxy for the chosen network.

**2.** Using the scan of the chosen network, trigger the function `create` of this contract with the following inputs (in order):

- The service id.
- The Mech Factory address for the selected network and payment model. To find the correct address, refer to the [configuration file](https://github.com/valory-xyz/ai-registry-mech/blob/v0.4.0/docs/configuration.json). Search for the address that matches the chosen payment model:

    - For Native, look for the MechFactoryFixedPriceNative address.

    - For Token: MechFactoryFixedPriceToken

    - For Nevermined, find MechFactoryNvmSubscriptionNative.

- The maximum price of the Mech (also called maxDeliveryRate), converted to Wei. In order to do this, first multiply 
the price in xDAI by 10^18. For instance, for a price of 1 xDAI, this 
is equal to 10^18. Then Use [ABI Hashex Encoder](https://abi.hashex.org/). Select uint256 as the type and enter the obtained value (for 1 xDAI this is 1000000000000000000 in wei). The tool will generate the encoded result, which is the following in the example: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a7640000. Finally add 0x at the beginning of the sequence to obtain 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a7640000 in the example. This is the sequence that should be entered. 


:warning: You must use the same EOA as the one used to deploy the service.

### 3.3 Running the Mech service

In order to run the Mech service that you created, follow the steps below.

Clone the `mech-predict` repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/valory-xyz/mech-predict.git
```

Then follow the instructions in the README.md file (section 'Running the Mech').

## 4. How to accrue the payments

In order to accrue the payments of your Mech, find [here](https://github.com/valory-xyz/ai-registry-mech/blob/v0.4.0/docs/configuration.json) the BalanceTracker contract which corresponds to the payment model of your Mech. The key is the following for each of the three payment models: 

- Native: BalanceTrackerFixedPriceNative

- Token: BalanceTrackerFixedPriceToken

- Nevermined: BalanceTrackerNvmSubscriptionNative

Enter its address in the scan of the chosen network. Click on "Contract" and then "Write Contract" and trigger the function processPaymentByMultisig. Enter the address of your Mech and click on "Write". This will transfer the funds stored in the Mech Marketplace to the address of your Mech contract. 

## Appendix : What is the Mech Marketplace ?

The Mech Marketplace is a collection of smart contracts designed to facilitate seamless interactions between agents or applications (referred to as requesters) and Mech agents which provide task-based services. Essentially, it acts as a relay, enabling secure, on-chain payments while ensuring efficient task requests and service delivery. 

Specifically, the Mech Marketplace enables the following.

- **Effortless Mech contract creation and delivery**: Any agent registered on the Olas Service registry can quickly deploy a Mech contract with minimal inputs. This streamlined process allows agents to rapidly offer their service and receive on-chain payments.

- **Seamless task execution requests**: Requesters—whether agents or applications—can opt to directly submit service requests through the Mech Marketplace. The on-chain contracts manage payments, ensuring a smooth and transparent interaction between requesters and Mech agents.

- **Guaranteed task completion**: A take-over mechanism is in place: if a designated Mech fails to respond within a deadline specified by the requester, any other available Mech can step in to complete the task. Therefore, there is a high likelihood that every request is fulfilled, maintaining the system’s reliability.
Karma - A reputation score system: The Karma contract tracks each Mech’s performance by maintaining a reputation score. This reflects how often a Mech successfully completes assigned tasks versus how often it fails. Mech agents that maintain high Karma scores are considered more trustworthy by requesters. Assuming honest participation, Mech agents that maintain high Karma scores are considered more trustworthy by requesters.

- **Competitive environment**: Mechs are incentivized to deliver outstanding results promptly in order to maintain high Karma scores and secure more tasks.
