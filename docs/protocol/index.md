The on-chain **Autonolas Protocol** anchors the Autonolas autonomous services -and in particular the current incarnation as agent services- on the target settlement layer and provides the primitives needed to create, operate and secure such services.
The protocol also provides a mechanism that incentivizes their creation and **rewards developers and service operators proportionally for their efforts to support the growth of the Autonolas ecosystem**.

Autonolas strives to incentivize software composability and reusability. Thus, the Autonolas Protocol reflects such composability by representing software components as NFTs, and incorporates a mechanism that enables combining them to take into account their actual software composition relationship. This is a crucial feature to measure their contribution and reward accordingly to the tokenomics model.

The Autonolas Protocol is [currently deployed](./technical_overview.md#contract-addresses) in Ethereum and GÃ¶rli chains, and it will be progressively deployed in all major blockchains.
