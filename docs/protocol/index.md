The **Autonolas Protocol** is a collection of smart contracts that implements the mechanism to secure open-source code on-chain, and provides incentives to developers proportionally for their efforts in supporting the growth of the Autonolas ecosystem. The protocol is built with the {{open_autonomy}} framework in mind as the primary framework for realizing agent services,  alternative frameworks can also be used.

There are three main elements that make up the protocol:

* The **On-Chain Registry** anchors Autonolas autonomous services on-chain, and provides the primitives needed to create, operate and secure such services.

* The **Tokenomics** defines economic model facilitated by the Autonolas token. This is a mechanism to grow the capital deployed in services and reward developers.

* The **Governance** defines the rules of Autonolas as a decentralized, autonomous
organization (DAO), which is governed by the community.

Autonolas strives to incentivize software composability and reusability. Thus, the Autonolas Protocol reflects such composability by representing software components as NFTs, and incorporates a mechanism that enables combining them to take into account their actual software composition relationship. This is a crucial feature to measure their contribution and reward according to the protocol tokenomics model.

The Autonolas Protocol is [currently deployed](./registry_technical_overview.md#contract-addresses) in Ethereum and GÃ¶rli chains, and it will be progressively deployed in all major blockchains.
