# Autonolas Developer Documentation

Welcome to the Autonolas Developer Documentation pages.

Autonolas' mission is to provide a foundation on which new types of autonomous applications can be built, and which applications can do the following:

* Run continuously.
* Take action on their own.
* Interact with the world outside of blockchains.
* Run complex logic.
* Be composed of self-contained application modules.
* Be crypto-native: decentralized, trust-minimized, transparent, and robust.

## The Autonolas Ecosystem

This documentation site aims at providing the technical background for the Autonolas Ecosystem components, including:

* The Open Autonomy framework.
* The On-chain Protocol.
* A number of already existing products in the ecosystem.

## Get involved

We are looking forward that you get involved with the Autonolas ecosystem and deploy your own autonomous services. If you have any question, or if you have found any missing information in these pages, or you are simply interested in knowing more about the project, we invite you to reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RHY6eJ35ar) and follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/autonolas).
