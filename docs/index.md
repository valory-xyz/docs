# Autonolas Developer Documentation

Autonolas' mission is to provide a foundation on which new types of autonomous applications can be built, which can:

* Run continuously.
* Take action on their own.
* Interact with the world outside of blockchains.
* Run complex logic.
* Be composed of self-contained application modules.
* Be crypto-native: decentralized, trust-minimized, transparent, and robust.

## The Autonolas Ecosystem

The Autonolas Ecosystem is composed of three main components:

* The [Open Autonomy framework](https://docs.autonolas.network/open-autonomy/).
* The on-chain [Autonolas Protocol](https://docs.autonolas.network/protocol/).
* A number of autonomous services which can be conveniently built with the provided [toolkits](https://docs.autonolas.network/products/).

## Get involved

We are looking forward that you get involved with the Autonolas ecosystem and deploy your own autonomous services. If you have any question, or if you have found any missing information in these pages, or you are simply interested in knowing more about the project, we invite you to reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RHY6eJ35ar) and follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/autonolas).
