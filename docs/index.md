Autonolas' mission is to provide a foundation on which new types of autonomous services can be built, which:

* Run continuously.
* Take action on their own.
* Interact with the world beyond blockchains.
* Run complex logic.
* Are composable.
* Are crypto-native: decentralized, trust-minimized, transparent, and robust.

## The Autonolas Stack

The Autonolas Stack is made of three main components:

* The [Open Autonomy](https://docs.autonolas.network/open-autonomy/)  framework.
* The [Autonolas Protocol](https://docs.autonolas.network/protocol/).
* A number of [toolkits](https://docs.autonolas.network/products/) for building a growing collection of autonomous services.
